# ScubaFix

A webtool to quick color correct images taken under water since my lilsis is currently in asia and is diving tons and snapping pics. I found some apps that you could download on ios / android but they were horrible and very limited, and also plastered their ugly watermarks all over the images. 

Time to see if i can put my years as a video color corrector to good use. 

Raw pic i got from my sis.
